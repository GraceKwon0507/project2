  <h1>South Korea</h1>

  <section class = "one">
    <h2>My Hometown, Seoul</h2>
    <p>Seoul is the capital city of South Korea. There are a lot of tourist attractions and famous restaurants.</p>
    <p>The Han River, which is the biggest river in Korea, is one of the prettiest places.</p>
    <p>At night, the bridge is lighted and the fountains are also really pretty.</p>

    <h2>My Second Hometown, Cheongju</h2>
    <p>My university was in Cheongju, which is located in Chung-cheong bukdo.</p>
    <p>Musimcheon, which is a lake in Cheonju, is famous for its beautiful view and pathways for people to walk.</p>
    <p>This picture was taken in spring. The cherry blossoms make the view even better.</p>

    <h2>Another City, Daejeon</h2>
    <p>Some of my relatives live in Daejeon, so I have been there several times.</p>
    <p>This summer, I went there with my mom because there was a beer festival.</p>
    <p>We had a chance to taste popular beer from different regions which was a great experience.</p>
    <p>Some booths had cups that could hold up to two kinds of beer.</p>
    <p>I really recommend going to one of the beer festivals if you go to Korea!</p>

    <p>Also, there is a famous bakery called Sungsimdang.</p>
    <p>There are a wide variety of goods there, so if you like bread, you must go to this place if you go to Daejeon!</p>
